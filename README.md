## Better Download

This is a simple browser extension, which adds a new item in the context menu for media elements. By default, it will download:

- all videos to `~/Downloads/videos`
- all audio to `~/Downloads/audio`
- all gifs to `~/Downloads/gifs`
- all images to `~/Downloads/images`

You can customize it slightly by downloading them to a common parent folder, and by prepending the domain name to the file name.
